# FMG Jinja CLI Templates for SD-WAN with ADVPN

FortiManager 7.0.1 includes built-in Jinja engine that allows you to use Jinja syntax for CLI Templates.
This repository contains a set of generic templates that configure underlay, overlay and routing of the SD-WAN/ADVPN solution.

In order to fine-tune it to your environment, you must edit `Globals.conf` template which is then imported by all other templates.

TBD: Describe `Globals.conf` and the necessary meta vars.
