# Reference Configuration: SD-WAN with ADVPN

This repository contains the following:

1. Reference FortiOS configuration for SD-WAN topologies with ADVPN (templated with Jinja).
   It covers overlay, routing, security and SD-WAN configuration.
   It can be rendered externally (a sample renderer is provided here as well) and applied directly on Fortigate devices.

2. Reference set of FortiManager CLI Templates for SD-WAN topologies with ADVPN (templated with Jinja).
   It covers underlay, overlay and routing.
   It can be used "as is" in the CLI Template Group, relying on the built-in Jinja support introduced in FortiManager 7.0.

Please refer to the README files under respective folders for more information.
